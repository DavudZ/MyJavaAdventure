# MyJavaAdventure

After i graduated from my tec-highschool in Jul.2019 i started looking for a Job as a Dev or Network-/Database-Administrator.
I started applying for Jobs and unfortunatly the Marked had no or little offer for a Junior C# .Net developer, but a lot of opportunities for Java devs.

So i created this Repo to practice my Java skills and Git.
